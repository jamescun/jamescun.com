It was terrible, nobody knew what anything did, but everything old is new again I guess&mldr;</p><p>Sure, it is a reasonable argument that as time goes on, as we develop and iterate on our system designs and components, their names will become less meaningful - and renaming them later near impossible.</p><p>But that&rsquo;s hardly an argument to throw out descriptive naming altogether!</p><p>It&rsquo;s always good to remember who the target audience is when we build something: the people who come after us (including ourselves, when our mental contexts have switched elsewhere), not the computer. The computer doesn&rsquo;t give two fucks what you call your fancy new microservice, it will run just the same.</p><p>Give components a descriptive name, it&rsquo;s function might change, but it will be easier to figure out the <code>notifications</code> service sends emails than if <code>galactus</code> does.</p></article><footer class=main>&copy; 2023 James Cunningham. <a href=https://github.com/jamescun/jamescun.com>Source</a>.</footer></body></html>
